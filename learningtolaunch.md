# Learning To Launch


## Start small (no, smaller than that)



- Why most folks want to launch stuff


- Founder/market fit
	- [You want more than product/market fit](https://justinjackson.ca/want/)
		- "I’ve come around to the idea that I just need to work on something that truly matters to me. I bought into all the talk about 'product market fit' without really thinking hard about where I fit." – Josh Smith, Talking Code
		- All the best things I've ever made were things I wanted to exist (not a hard rule, but not a bad starting point either)
		- "Serving an audience you don’t like is one of the worst feelings in the world. You have to show up every day and answer their emails, fix their bugs, reset their passwords. To do customer research you need hang out with them a lot. To get sales? You have to go to tradeshows, make contacts, call them on the phone. Put another way: if you don’t like cats, don’t start a feline rescue center."
	- What does success look like?
		- What does success not look like?
			- Working until I'm 65
			- If side project is for marketing
- Founder/product fit

- Simple ideas > complicated ideas
	- If you can't explain your idea in a sentence
	- FlashTabs = success

- Traction is one by one
	- Find something that resonates with people
	- "Failure" ≠ failure
		- Learning people don't want something isn't failure, it's learning that goes into the foundation of your next thing
