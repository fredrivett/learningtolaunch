This talk is for those who:
- Want to get better at launching their own side projects

This talk is **not** about how to have the perfect launch

It's about how to get better at taking a project from idea to launch

## As we'll come to later: the majority of people fall at this hurdle

---

class: center, middle

# "So why should I care?" 🤷‍♀️

---

## Who am I? 🧔🏻

--

- Been designing in Photoshop for literally half of my life (14 years), coding for 11

--

- Spent 5 years trying to launch side projects —> 0 launches

--

- Next 5 years —> launched 12 projects (incl. a SaaS: UserCompass)

--

- Front-end dev by trade

--

  - Specialise in writing front end code that's not horrible

--

  - Lead front-end at The Peoples Operator, a social good virtual mobile network operator, working directly with Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales

???

- One of our projects has 5000 WAU
- Winner April Fools 2017

## Who is this for? 👤

- This talk is for those who want to get better at launching their own side projects

--

  - You may have launched in the past but gone rusty

--

  - Or may have never launched anything of your own (client work doesn't count)

---

class: center, middle

### It's a common problem 😕

.full-size-image[![Want to launch stuff tweet poll](assets/images/wanttolaunchtweet.png)]

???

- A lot of people want to launch stuff (98% of my biased source (twitter followers))
- 75% of people know they need to get better at shipping
- Probably higher % struggle with it, biased source of active makers following

---

## Why launch your own side projects? 🤨

???

We'll go into the why behind a project a bit more later in the talk

--

- For fun (the kid in us still likes to make stuff and explore)

--

- To learn/level up (to try out something new)

--

- For marketing (to bring attention to something else)

---

## This talk has 2️⃣ parts

--

1️⃣ My story 🙋‍♂️

2️⃣ Lessons learned (how to avoid wasting 5 years like we did) 🤔

# My story 🙋‍♂️

### Designing forum signatures in Photoshop as a teenager 🎨

???

[examples]

- During college (16-18y in UK) got to know a guy called Mike
- He was starting a new web development business with another guy from college
- Needed a logo

## ~ "I love it, you're in!" 🤝

— Mike, 2007

???

Sidenote: Mike still kind of likes that old logo, which is the basis of me taking his aesthetic feedback with a pinch of salt

---

class: center, middle

### ~ Gradually dabbled with front-end code 👨‍💻 ~

---

class: center, middle

### ~1 year in, business just about breaking even covering my Adobe licenses, I decide to go off to Theology College, business shuts down ❌

---

class: center, middle

### But Mike & I stay in touch 📬

---

### Over the next 5 years, continue to dream about big business ideas and work months at a time on many of them. Including: 👀

--

- LiveSlides: _Presentation software with crowd interactivity [polls, q&a etc]_

--

- PushToMe: _Push notifications as a service for those without an app_

???

E.g. If you are a bakery and want to send a push notification to let folks know their order is ready

--

- ido.plumbing: _Simple websites for specific industries_

???

With the goldrush of new GTLD's I ended up spending hundred's of pounds on a bunch of random domains, a couple of which were ido.plumbing & ido.construction

I still own idrink.coffee and breakdown.repair (despite not drinking much coffee and not offering breakdown repair)

---

class: center, middle

### But by early 2014, we had spent another few months on a side project, another one that never came close to launching 😔

???

- Frustration returns, we're in that place again where the shiny idea we dreamt of is nowhere to be seen and we're disillusioned with the process

---

class: center, middle

### "BUT we've got the technical skills to design and code a website, surely we just need to keep trying?"

— us

???

And then Mike hit the nail on the head when he said:

# `*AWAKENING*`

This is where we really started to step back and look at the past 5 years and realised that we just couldn't go on as we were.

We realised we had created a NEVER ENDING PROJECT CYCLE OF DOOM

# SixBySix was born 🐣

???

SixBySix was the idea to try and launch six projects in six months, one per month.

My initial reaction was:

---

class: center, middle

### "Lol we can't even launch one in five years how we gonna launch six in six months?" 🤨
— me

???

- Even though we were both used to working to deadlines in our day jobs, we always saw building our own things as "we will launch when it's 'done'".

---

class: center, middle

#### ~ LESSON ~

## Learn to 🚶‍♂️ before trying to 🏃‍♂️

???

- I really fought hard against this internally
  - I had ambitions to run a business that earnt money
  - I wanted to focus on one thing, not put off that focus for half a year

- SixBySix looked like a simple plan to work on six projects in six months.
  - But really, it wasn't about working on projects at all, it was about working on ourselves.
  - The projects were just a byproduct of that.

- We needed to invest in ourselves

### The Never Ending Project Cycle of Doom

.max-size-image[![NEVER ENDING PROJECT CYCLE OF DOOM](assets/images/cycleofdoom.png)]

— [@acejon](https://twitter.com/acejon) ✍️

???

- A vicious, brainless cycle that was leading to nowhere
- Weren't self aware of it
- Replace it with a healthy habit:
  - How do we do that? Some tips to follow...

---

class: center, middle

### The habit we form today becomes the baseline from which we build tomorrow's habit 🔄

???

- Set a too ambitious habit today, you might manage it for a short-period, but it'll soon drop off
- Start a small, simple habit, and you're more likely to stick with it, at which point you can build on top of it for your next habit

- My goal to run 10k this year
- If I ran 10k first time
  - would hurt
  - put me off running

- Instead, set small achievable goals, and build from there

---

### Compound growth 📈

[graph of compound growth]

- Set a too ambitious habit today, you might manage it for a short-period, but it'll soon drop off

### We are creatures of habit 📅

The vast majority of life is lived mindlessly running on autopilot

???

If you can create good autopilot habits then you can achieve a lot more with less effort

---

class: center, middle

### Launching is a skill like any other, it is learnt by deliberate practice 🎯

???

As we saw in the poll earlier, most people want to launch and aren't good at it

---

class: center, middle

### Think longer term 🔭

I really struggled with the idea of investing 6 months in a training program, I wanted to run straight to the end goal, running a business. (That's just plain silly)

???

Gotta learn the basics first

---

class: center, middle

## Underestimate habits at your peril 🙅‍♂️

---

## Understand your why: Why do you want to ship stuff? 🤔

???

- Self aware
- Super important to understand why you're doing this

--

- For fun (the kid in us still likes to make stuff and explore — this is good)

???

- If for fun, that's fine, the most prolific maker on Product Hunt, Mubs, makes stuff for fun, not specifically to run a business
- The buzz of a Product Hunt / Hacker News launch and watching the real time counter on Google Analytics go up
- I remember our first launch, I was glued to the analytics panel all day after a late night getting things ready, and began to feel physically sick as the day wore on

--

- To learn/level up (to try out something new, a new tool like Webflow/Carrd or a new language/framework)

--

- To market yourself (to grow your own "brand", get known in the industry)

--

- To work towards a goal of building a business

--

- For marketing another project (to bring attention to something else)

  - aka "Side project marketing"

???

- Ali Mese (founder Growth Supply, The Startup, biggest startup blog on Medium) blog post: [Side project marketing](https://medium.com/swlh/side-product-marketing-is-the-new-king-a75c4ed0c0c5)
- Crew hacked together Unsplash, a super simple site with 10 photos on. Unsplash is now the main business, and has raised $7.25m
  - 400,000 photos, downloaded more than 310 million times
  - Over 2,000 Unsplash photos are viewed across the web every second

### “Give Something Valuable Away in Order to Sell Something Related.” 🎁
— Brian Clark

???

- Marketing is all about standing out from the crowd
- Blogging is normal now, not remarkable
- Create value
- Easier than ever to ship a side project


- Seth Godin says marketing is about being remarkable
- People like to share things that are remarkable, potential to go viral
- Side projects are a great way to do this
- Tom Scott (Youtuber) made a "Northometer", how Northern are you. Answer a few questions and it told you how northern you were. Was shared over a million times.

# "But I don't have time" 🤥

???

- 99% of people, this isn't true
- Might be busy, calendar might be full, but can still make time
- If it's important, you can find time

---

## Prioritise your priorities 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣

--

- I used to commute 3 hours per day 🚂

--

- 15h a week

--

- 60h a month

--

- 660h a year (allowing 1 month holiday/year)

--

- That's equiv. to the whole month of February

--

- **Including time spent sleeping** 💤

--

- 1/12th of my whole year, including sleeping time, was spent commuting

--

- Find a small amount of *consistent* time (one evening a week / half an hour every morning)

--

- Start moving towards your goals 💪

---

# "But I don't have any good ideas" 🧠❌

???

**It's important to note you're not trying to make the next Facebook, just get better at shipping**

Here's a few ways to get some ideas:

--

- Your own pain/friction points 🤕

???

Write notes down, keep a running list of pains/ideas

FlashTabs was a pain I had, I wanted to use Flashcards to learn, but the leading solution, Anki, required developing a new habit and looked like it was made in the 1990s

--

- Something that makes you laugh 😂

???

Bluffball made us laugh, so we made it

--

- Ask others what they want / observe others frustrations 👀

???

This is harder, especially when starting out, requires another skillset on top of shipping (customer development)

--

- Find something that's not very good and make it better ✨

---

class: center, middle

# Ride the wave 🌊🏄‍♂️
What's popular now? What are people already talking about? 👂

???

- Justin Jackson has a great blog post on this: https://megamaker.co/articles/growth/
- StoriesAsAService was popular because it captured a running joke. It was just a shoddily thrown together landing page.
- Tinder could do a side project around Love Island, who would you match with?

---

# Just ship something 🚢

???

- BUT if you've never shipped, don't worry about long term success. Just ship anything

## If you only remember 1️⃣ thing

# Start small 🌱

&nbsp;

---

class: center, middle

# Start small 🌱

👉 No, smaller than that 👈

???

- One of the most common pieces of advice you will hear is to start small.
- When you hear the same advice from multiple people it's for a reason.

- When Mike & I chose HowsItGoin as our first project, we thought it was small and simple, smaller than some of our other ideas.
- It took 250 hours and launched 2 weeks past our monthly deadline.

---

class: center, middle

## So how do I start small? 🤔

---

class: center, middle

#### ~ Start small ~

# MVP 🌱

### [Minimum Viable Product]

???

- This is the smallest slice you can put out that will provide some learning back

---

class: center, middle

### Valuable (desirable) 😍
### Viable (feasible to build, able to connect supply with demand, develop habits) ⚖️

MVP is about testing these two as quick as poss ☝️

???

- The best way to succeed is to find the essence of something that is valuable (desirable) and viable (feasible to build, able to connect supply with demand)
- Scrappy is good and necessary

---

### Be ruthless with what you allow into your initial feature set ✂️

--

- Only include the very core of what you need for it to work

???

Understanding how your users will come back is important though, notifications / emails

Website like The Working Lunch, having just a website is probably not going to work, an email list works better

--

- Can even just test demand with a landing page (Buffer & Ghost both did this)

--

- Allow for unknown unknowns (things will always take longer than expected)

---

class: center, middle

# Set a deadline ❌📅

???

- Mike and I used to work "until it was done", spoiler alert: it never was
- Gives you something to aim for
- Forces you to ship something

---

#### *and finally...*

--

# Tell someone 🗣

???

- Accountability is key. Use your own brain against itself. No-one wants to be the person who said they would do something then didn't

--

- heck tell anyone who will listen 📣

--

- Tell your mum, tell your cat 🐈

--

- tweet it into the void 🐦

--

- post it on medium ✍️

???

- Blogging is good for this
- Mike and I blogged in public with everything we did

--

- just don't keep it to yourself 🙊

---

class: center, middle

#### 🚨 Spoiler alert 🚨

### Your project will probably fail ☠️

???

- The chances of success for any project are small, that's just the reality

- Most ideas are bad or fatally flawed

- One or more of your assumptions are probably wrong

- **They don't get that much bigger via more effort**

---

class: center, middle

### It's hard to predict the winners from the sidelines 🔮


???

- The winners are found out once the final whistle is over, so ship and then see
- Tom Scott recently spoke about this in his new series [How To Be Popular On The Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0AMaW4XRCI)
  - Shipping lots of little things best way to learn
  - Can build on the successes, and drop the failures
  - Look as successful people, their current project is rarely their first

### "If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late." 😬
— Reid Hoffman (Founder, LinkedIn)

???

- This is really hard to do.
- As a maker you have pride in your work, and hopefully have some taste


- With The Dot, we're dropping our most important feature because it would put back launch by 2-3 weeks.
- We can learn a lot about the core by launching something now (that makes me a bit embarrassed).
- If the absolute core doesn't work, then we can fix that before adding in this next feature.

### The 3️⃣ most "successful" launches I've ever had were three of the smallest

???

- FlashTabs: 77 hours, 5k WAU, consistent for the past 3 years
- Stories As A Service: 6h, Winner April Fools Day 2017, over 20k page views
- ProductHaunt: 3h, 500 upvotes on Product Hunt


- The products we spent the most time on are all totally dead now
- The best way to find what's worth working on is to run lots of little, diverse experiments and see which resonates the most (both with others, and with yourself)

# "But I can't code" 👩‍💻

---

class: center, middle

### Product Hunt started as an email list 😸💌

???

- It was acquired for $20m
- Constraints inspire creativity

---

### You don't need to code to ship stuff ❌👩‍💻🚢

--

- Tools now are so good, you can piece things together with Carrd, Airtable, Webflow, Typeform and many others

--

- Ben Tossell isn't a coder but is one of the most prolific makers on Product Hunt

--

- He's teaching how to do that at [newco.app](https://www.newco.app/)












---

### There is no perfect formula for success 😕

--

- Just wisdom 🧠

--

- There are exceptions to ~every rule ❌

--

- Chart your own path (don't follow your heroes) 👣

???

- [Justin Jackson has a good post on this](https://justinjackson.ca/heroes/)

.max-size-image[![Advice tweet](assets/images/advice.png)]

- CHECK IF THEY ARE OK WITH ME SAYING THIS. Friend's of mine have recently turned down a multimillion pound acquisition offer for their company. A couple of years ago they went 6 months, working full-time, with ZERO new customers.

# All that said... 🗣

--

- There's nothing like first hand experience 🤲

--

- Go make your own glorious mistakes 🤦‍♂️

--

- _(just try not to waste 5 years like we did)_ 😬
